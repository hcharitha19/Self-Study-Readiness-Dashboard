# Self-Study Readiness Dashboard – Behavioral Analytics

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze behavioral factors affecting job aspirants during their preparation journey.

The dashboard focuses on psychological indicators such as confidence, fear, and consistency to generate actionable insights about growth readiness and performance risk.

It transforms mindset variables into measurable, data-driven insights.

---

## Dashboard Objectives

Analyze behavioral readiness levels
Identify risk of stagnation
Measure confidence vs fear impact
Evaluate consistency influence on growth
Classify aspirants into performance categories
Enable interactive self-assessment

---

## Key KPIs

Confidence Level
Fear Level
Consistency Score
Self Stability Score
Confidence Gap
Growth Readiness Classification

---

## Tech Stack

Power BI Desktop
DAX (Measures & Conditional Logic)
What-If Parameters
Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
CSV / Structured Dataset

---

## Data Source

The behavioral structure is inspired by academic research dataset:

Dataset on self-confidence, motivation, and anxiety
Mendeley Data (Elsevier Open Access)

Dataset Link:
[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hccbrpzw7k/3](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hccbrpzw7k/3)

The dataset was transformed into a structured analytical model using fact and dimension tables.
